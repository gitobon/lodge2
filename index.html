Diani, and perhaps, the whole of Coastal Kenya is the believed to be the origin of East African Civilization. Little is known about Diani’s specific history but shreds of evidence suggest that her history can be traced back in the 8th Century AD. In the 9th century, the Indian and Arab traders started to mingle with the indigenous population to create the unique Swahili cultures, much of which is still thriving until this day. During this period, the whole Coastal region of Kenya enjoyed a golden age of trade. In the 15th Century, the Portuguese arrived at the Kenyan Coast and effectively dominated the region for 2 centuries after which the Oman Arabs took over. At the turn of the 19th century, the British established a foothold and declared the coast a British Protectorate. Jadini Beach Hotel was the first tourist hotel to be built in Diani beach back in 1937. It was formerly a cottage. Trade Winds and Two Fishes followed later as tourism took off in Diani. Today, Diani is regarded as one of the best beach destinations in the World as well as the leading beach destination in Africa. The indigenous people of Diani are the Digo Community who are the the second-largest tribe of the 9 Mijikenda tribes. With an estimated population of 400,000, the Digo are concentrated on the southern coastal strip of Kenya specifically Diani and the border of Tanzania. The Digo people speak chidigo, which is a Bantu language closely related to both Swahili and the other Mijikenda languages. Over 90% of Digo people are Islams. Diani boosts of a vibrant culture drawn from the different communities and nations who live here. Despite the cultural mix that Diani boosts of, the indigenous locals culture remains alive, known for their warmness and accommodating nature, the locals hold visitors in high regard as visitors are believed to be a source of blessings. As vibrant as the culture, so is the night life, as the sun fades away, Diani transcends to become the life of the party. Endowed with various night clubs and great music, her people rise to the occasion with unreserved energy making the most of each moment, this is how memories are made here.

Its high humidity brings a pleasant sea breeze which perfectly balances out the African sun and is also the reason for Diani’s ideal kitesurfing conditions. Contrary to what one might think, the best time to visit Diani Beach in Kenya is between the cooler months of July to September and the dry months from December to March. The region experiences a mild rainy season starting towards the end of April / beginning of May and lasting until July, but don’t let this stop you from traveling during this time. Rainfall during the rainy season usually occurs in the late afternoon or during the night which means that it won’t interfere with your daily routine. If you are sensitive to high temperatures, August is the ideal time to travel to Diani Beach as it is also considered the “coldest” month with an average of 24 Celsius (compared to its warmest month in March with an average temperature of 29 Celsius!).
